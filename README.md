# CHESS_USING_DQN
This is all about chess movement using neural network DQN.

 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elements
1.Evaluative Feedback: In RL, agents receive feedback on actions they take in the environment.
Action-Value Methods: These methods evaluate actions based on their expected rewards.
Incremental Implementation: Techniques to update value estimates incrementally as new data comes in.
2.Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing between exploring new actions to find better rewards and exploiting known actions that have given high rewards.
3.Markov Decision Processes (MDP): Framework for RL where outcomes depend on both current state and action.


 Elementary Solution Methods
1.Dynamic Programming (DP)
2.Monte Carlo Methods
3.Temporal Difference (TD) Learning


 Algorithms in Stochastic Chess Piece Movement Using DQN
1.Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD Control): A well-known RL algorithm where the agent learns optimal policies by updating action values independently of the policy being followed.
2.Deep Q-Network (DQN): A deep learning-based extension of Q-Learning that uses neural networks to approximate value functions in complex environments like chess.
